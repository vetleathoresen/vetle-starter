// three hundred now no longer varies by two minutes, it varies by a hundred
// and fifty, and an ordinary day reads thousands of points from 100. That
// number is arithmetic, not a reading.
//
// The test is the variation and never the level. A stock that simply got
// better sits far from its baseline mean and still varies by about what it
// used to: that is the case the index was built for, and it keeps its number,
// because there is no ceiling. A stock whose variation is OUTGROWN times what
// it was has lost the unit itself, and there is nothing honest left to draw.
// Reading the level instead would put a ceiling back on, and refuse the

//

// meet the reading measures nothing. A total that grows has no level to
// measure around: track a rate, which does, or start the stock clean under a

// first thirty days were four people watching a whole video varies by twenty
// points of percentage; the same channel with strangers clicking varies by
// three. The index is then drawn in a unit seven times too big: it barely

// ---- levers against outcomes: a scan too ----
//
// A goal names its outcomes, the stocks it is made of, and can name levers:
// stocks you move, each read a declared 1 or 2 days later. Every lever is
// read against every outcome of its own goal, and the question is only
// this: after the days the lever read above its usual, was the outcome's
// index different from after the days it read below?
//
// It is a scan, so the answer is a lead, never a finding. A lead becomes a
// finding the one way the Wire has: make it a commit and let testCommit judge.
// So it is set to miss few real links and let a few coincidences through: a
// false lead costs one commit and dies at that gate, a missed link is never
// tested at all.
//
// What keeps a coincidence from reading as a lead:
//   - Weekdays are levelled first and each outcome is read against the four
//     weeks around it, so a Monday rhythm or a channel that grows for months
//     is not a lever. A habit that starts, stops or moves to another day is
//     read inside its own stretches; blocks of work weeks, seasons and rotas
//     against the nearest weeks of the same weekday.
//   - A lever that moves with a whole busy week is read against the other
//     days of its week, and the outcome on the lever's own day and the day
//     before are taken out, so a busy week or an illness that moves both is
//     not taken for the lever.
//   - Each finished week is one block of the standard error, and every
//     reading comes from a finished week, so the week still running changes
//     nothing.
//   - The bar starts at SCAN_BAR and rises with every question the goals
//     have ever asked, and with how few weeks there are.
//   - The same reading runs against the outcome on the lever's own day, which
//     the lever could not have caused. If that is as large, the answer is
//     'before': the outcome already differed on the lever's day, so this
//     lever cannot be told apart from it.
//
// What no data can answer: a lever that reads the same on every one of its
// weekdays every week, like a drink on every single Saturday, is the week
// itself. Its verdict is 'fixed': change it for a few weeks as a commit,
// and testCommit can answer.

//
// The lever is read against its usual level for that weekday. When a
// weekday's reading tends to repeat the week before, something slower than
// the lever is moving it.
//
// If one or two changes of level on each weekday account for that (a habit
// that starts, stops, thins out or moves to another day) and most of the
// lever's movement is left inside the stretches between them, the lever is
// still read against its usual level, unless that reading comes out beyond
// the one inside the stretches by two standard errors: then the stretches
// are doing it, and each day is read only against its own stretch.
//
// Otherwise (blocks of work weeks, a season, a rota) each day is read only
// against the nearest readings of its own weekday, about two weeks either
// side, and a day where those readings sit on one side of the lever's middle
// and then switch to the other side and stay is a switch, not a week the
// lever moved, so it is left out.
//
// Each day is then read against the other days of its own week, leaving out
// the days next to its outcome, so a busy week that moves the lever and the
// outcome together cancels.
//
// The outcome is read against its weekday and the four weeks around it. When
// the lever is read against its usual level, the outcome on the lever's own
// day and the day before are taken out inside the estimate: whatever they
// explain is not the lever's.
//
// The effect is the outcome's change for each unit of the lever, times the
// lever's usual distance between a high and a low day. For a lever with two
// values it is the plain difference. Each finished week is one block of its
// standard error.
//
// When the lever read against its usual level moves on several days of the
// same week together, the effect is read once more with each day against
// only the other days of its week that the lever moves, each scaled to its
// weekday's own spread. If the first reading comes out beyond that one by two
