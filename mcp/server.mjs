// BODY over MCP. Claude reads your readings, and writes only the one you gave it.
//
// Four tools, and one door beside them: api/photo.mjs takes a photo from the
// phone and writes its progress_photo row through the same sign-in.
// record writes one events row for any metric the user names, exactly as the
// page would, signed source 'claude'. list names every metric already in the
// record, so a new name is never made where an old one will do. estimate writes a guess Claude read off a photo the user
// sent, signed source 'photo', under a name ending _est, so an estimate and a
// measurement can never be taken for one another. history reads one metric
// back. There is no update and no delete. It signs in as you with the publishable key, so the same row level
// security that protects the page protects this.
//
// This file is the server and both tools, defined once. api/mcp.mjs serves it
// over HTTP on Vercel; dev.js serves it locally.
